#autoFuzz.py

###Description

URL fuzzing can often lead to some interesting results, potentially highlighting an error that could lead to a security vulnerability.
With this tool we seek to automate some of the tedious labor away of passing strings to a web application. 
Additionally it checks for the low hanging fruit of injection text into a 404 page, which could be a Social Engeering or MITM attack vector. 


If you have an suggestions or feedback let me know, I'm always looking to improve.
